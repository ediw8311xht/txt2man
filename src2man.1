.SH NAME
\fBsrc2man \fP- extract man pages from source files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBsrc2man\fP [\fB-n\fP][\fB-d\fP date][\fB-v\fP volume][\fB-r\fP \fIrelease\fP] [\fIsrcfile\fP \.\.\.]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsrc2man\fP scans source file \fIsrcfile\fP. Only C source files are supported
for now. Comments blocks starting by "/** num", where num is a section
number, are converted into a man file, using \fBtxt2man\fP(1).
.PP
The first line of the comment block must contain the name of the
manpage, usually the function name, followed by a "-" and a short
description. The following lines are the "DESCRIPTION" section
content, except if they are in upper case, in which case they define
a new section.
.PP
If the next line after a comment block is empty, Then no "SYNOPSIS"
section will be generated. Otherwise, \fBsrc2man\fP will look in the following
source lines for a function prototype or a type definion (struct,
union, typedef, \.\.\.) matching the manpage name, and include it in a
"SYNOPSIS" section. This avoids to duplicate the type or function
prototype in the comment block.
.PP
The best place for code documentation is in the source file, where
the body is implemented, not the header file which only contains
the prototype. \fBsrc2man\fP automatically searches for the presence of a
prototype in the corresponding header file, and if found, will print a
"#include" statement in the synopsis.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP date
Set the date of the man pages. Defaults to current date.

\fB-v\fP volume
Specify the name of the volume to be printed in center header
of generated manpages.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP \fIrelease\fP
Specify the project name and \fIrelease\fP number for the generated

.SH ENVIRONMENT

SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
Unix timestamp that is used for date in header instead

.SH EXAMPLE
The following example displays C code and comments to generate a manpage
foobar.3:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     /** 3
      * foobar - a sample dummy function
      * This line is now the first of the description section.
      * Note that function parameters parm1 and parm2 are highlighted
      * in the generated man page.
      */
     int foobar(char *parm1, int parm2)
     {
        \.\.\.
        return 0;
     }
